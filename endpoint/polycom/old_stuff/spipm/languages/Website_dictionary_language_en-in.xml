In Log File Upload you can specify logging frequency and the append options. In Module Log Level Limits, you can specify a logging level for each type of log. Modifying the logging levels of individual components enables you to capture low severity events in one part of the application while capturing high severity events for other components. Note that when you choose a log level, you are including all events of a greater severity level and excluding events of a lower severity level. The logging level you choose determines the lowest severity of events that will be logged. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individual log level settings available in Module Log Level Limits cannot be logged at a severity level lower than the level set in Global Log Level Limit. Note that changing default logging levels for individual sub-systems is generally required for troubleshooting purposes only.
