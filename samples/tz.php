	The interface to this class is approximately a subset of PHP 5.3's
	DateTimeZone. This lets you use the DateTimeZone class (or a subset
	thereof) in earlier versions of PHP. The name of the class is the
	same, and if DateTimeZone is already provided, this file does nothing.

	This class seems to have slightly different timezone info than
	the standard DateTimeZone, this has only been confirmed in December 
	1901; probably due to a different time database, or different handling.
	There may be other discrepancies.

DIFFERENCES:
	The following things are different in this library from the standard
	PHP5.3 implementation:

	* This library will only work on Linux boxes, with timezone information
		in /usr/share/zoneinfo, and with tzdump.
	* None of the procedural-style functions. You have to create an object
		and query it.
	* NO CONSTANTS 
	* getLocation - NOT IMPLEMENTED - I don't know where this data 
		comes from
	* getTransitions - this does not take any parameters, and always
		returns ALL transitions. NOTE ALSO - the data used to create
		the transition list is the data from zdump - this seems to
		differ slightly from the native PHP5.3 implementation
		(so far only confirmed around December 1901).
	* listAbbreviations - NOT IMPLEMENTED
	* listIdentifiers - List of timezones differs slightly from the
		PHP 5.3 implementation on my box - there are some extra
		timezones reported by this library. I have not done an 
		exhaustive comparison. For example, on my box, this function
		lists both Africa/Asmara and Africa/Asmera, whereas PHP 5.3
		only lists one of these.
